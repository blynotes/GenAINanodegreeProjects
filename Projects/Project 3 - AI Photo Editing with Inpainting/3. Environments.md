# Environments
## Project Environment
The environment to fully run the project is already setup for you. It has already pre-installed a series of dependencies, including `pytorch`, `diffusers`, and `gradio`.

## Workspace Instructions
Start the workspace and activate the GPU usage. Then follow the instructions contained in the notebook.

If for any reason you run into trouble, you can:

1. Restart the notebook and try again. In most cases this solves the problem.
2. Refresh the workspace by using the menu in the lower-left corner and select 'Refresh Workspace'. This will re-deploy your work on a new machine. You won't be losing any progress, but you will have to run the cells from the beginning of the notebook
