## Project Instructions

When you start the workspace you will land in a Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions contained there step by step, being on the lookout for sections marked by `YOUR CODE HERE`.

The gradio app that allows for the interactive experience showcased above is already built for you, you will be able to start it from within the notebook. Then, by clicking on a link, you will be taken to a new tab with the gradio UI available for use.

After completing the code, spend some time playing around in the app. Try to modify the parameters like the Classifier-Free Guidance Scale or the random seed - which you now understand - and see which results you get.

## App instructions

Once you have completed the exercise, the notebook will generate an app to use the functions you wrote in an interactive way.
