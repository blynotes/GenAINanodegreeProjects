# Project Overview
## Project Introduction
Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.

In this project, you will apply __parameter-efficient fine-tuning__ using the Hugging Face `peft` library.

## Project Summary
In this project, you will bring together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, you will:

1. Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
2. Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
3. Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
