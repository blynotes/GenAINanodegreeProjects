## Explore a Different OpenAI API
If you're interested in digging deeper into custom chatbots with OpenAI, consider checking out their [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) API. This allows you to use your own labeled training data to customize the model outputs, applying a supervised machine learning approach also known as transfer learning. The training data for this kind of project would need to follow this format:
```python
{
  "prompt": "<prompt text>",
  "completion": "<ideal generated text>"
}
```
and OpenAI recommends that you have "at least a couple hundred" prompt/completion examples before performing fine-tuning.
