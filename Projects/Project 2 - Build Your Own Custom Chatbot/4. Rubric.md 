# Project: Build an OpenAI Chatbot
## Code
| Success Criteria  | Specifications  |
|:------------------|:----------------|
| Data Wrangling | Project dataset is loaded into a pandas dataframe containing at least 20 rows. Each row in the dataset contains a text sample in a column named "text" |
| Custom Query Completion | The project successfully sends a custom query with information from the project dataset to the OpenAI model and gets a response |

## Scenario
| Success Criteria  | Specifications  |
|:------------------|:----------------|
| Demonstrate that custom prompts enhance the performance of the OpenAI model | The notebook includes at least two questions that result in different answers when using the custom prompt compared to a basic prompt to the same model.<br /><br />This means that there should be 4 total Q&A pairs: 2 questions with the custom answers and those same 2 questions with the basic answers |
| Select a dataset for generating custom prompts and explain the rationale | The notebook includes at least one sentence explaining why the chosen dataset is appropriate for this application |

> ## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
> 1. Use a `while` loop and the built-in `input` function to allow the user to type questions repeatedly rather than having to edit the content of strings in the code cells
> 2. Take a closer look at your dataset and perform additional data cleaning to remove irrelevant content or augment the content
